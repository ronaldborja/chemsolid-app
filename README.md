## Desktop Application to Size Screen, Mills, Screws, Bucket Elevators & Conveyor Belts. 

Authors: Kaleth Padillla and Ronald Borja <br>
Tutors: Jorge Piñeres and Luis Obregon

In this project, we developed a desktop application programmed in Python using the QtDesinger library for the sizing of screens, mills, screws, bucket elevators and conveyor belts. The main objectives of this project were:

* Develop a computational package in Python as a support tool in the teaching process in the Solids Management subject of the Chemical Engineering program at the Universidad del Atlántico.
* Develop a friendly user interface that allows automating the sizing of equipment used in the handling of solids in a continuous state, such as conveyor belts, worm screws, bucket elevators, vibrating screens, ball mills, roller mills, crushers cone and jaw crushers.
* Develop modules that allow the user to obtain the solution of any variable involved in the design equations of the equipment studied.
* Determine the functionality of the computer package from tests using different case studies.
